Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess. In this project, we are going to predict the price of a flight considering some features such as Airline, Source, Destination, Route, Date of Journey, Total Stops, and some additional info.

## Features of Dataset: 
* Airline: The name of the airline. 
* Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey 
* Source: The source from which the service begins. 
* Destination: The destination where the service ends. 
* Route: The route was taken by the flight to reach the destination. 
* Dep_Time: The time when the journey starts from the source. 
* Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination. 
* Duration: Total duration of the flight. 
* Total_Stops: Total stops between the source and destination. 
* Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight. 
* Price: The price of the ticket

2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Outlier Detection
4. Feature Selection
5. Building Machine Learning Models

## Objectives
The main objectives of creating a Flight Price Prediction Machine Learning Model include the following:

* Price forecasting: The model can predict the future prices of flights, which can help airlines and travel agencies to adjust their prices accordingly and remain competitive.
* Inventory management: The model can be used to predict flight demand, which can help airlines and travel agencies optimize their inventory and avoid overbooking or underbooking.
* Revenue optimization: The model can maximize revenue by predicting the prices at which flights will sell the most, which can help airlines and travel agencies adjust their prices accordingly.
* Personalized pricing: The model can be used to personalize pricing for different customers by considering factors such as their past purchase history, location, and demographics.
* Anomaly Detection: The model can detect abnormal prices, which can help airlines and travel agencies identify pricing errors or fraud.

Overall, the goal of creating a flight price prediction model is to improve pricing decisions, optimize inventory and revenue, and improve customer experience.

## Conclusion
We implemented a lot of techniques in this project. We saw how we can perform exploratory data analysis and feature selection when we have a large number of features. At the end, we have successfully built the Flight Price Prediction Machine Learning Model to predict the price of flights which will help us to select the best possible travel route and to reach our destination according to our own demand and utility.
